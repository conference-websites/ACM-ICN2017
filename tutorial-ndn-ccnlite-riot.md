### Motivation

Information-Centric Networking (ICN) is a promising approach
to address the needs of Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications
natively at the network level. Instead of sending
packets between source and destination devices identified by
numeric IP addresses, in ICN the network disseminates the
named and secured pieces of data, forwarding directly on names
that carry application semantics, avoiding the need to do complex
mapping between applications names and network identifiers.

In this tutorial we introduce tools needed to build and evaluate
IoT applications using ICN. Using a set of simple driving
application examples, we plan to demonstrate a functional ICN
interactions across different hardware and software platforms,
raning from constrained devices (e.g., ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers)
up to fully-fledged systems (e.g., Laptops). Our
joint team of RIOT, NDN, and CCN-lite developers will guide
participants through the hands-on exercises and deployment
processes, encouraging interested students and researchers to
further engage with ICN in IoT.

### Tutorial outline (full day schedule)


The full-day tutorial (9 hours including coffee breaks and
lunch) consists of three parts:

* ICN/IoT background (1.5 hours)
* Core concepts of RIOT, NDN-RIOT and CCN-lite (1.5 hours)
* Hands-on programming with NDN-RIOT and CCN-Lite on RIOT or UNIX based systems (4 hours)

#### ICN/IoT Background
We will start introducing ICN principles and highlight unique
characteristics of ICN for building IoT applications. Later, a
short demo presents the functionality and interoperability of
the presented components and teases what will be shown in
the tutorial.

Data security is one important requirement for IoT applications.
Unlike traditional TCP/IP stack, ICN embeds security
primitives in the networking layer-each data packet keeps integrity,
authenticity, and (when needed) confidentiality properties
no matter where it is stored or how it is retrieved. As part
of this introduction, we will highlight important properties of
ICN/NDN data-centric security and showcase existing work to
automate its complex parts.

#### Essential Concepts and Tools
In this part we will present various ICN tools that are available
in the context of IoT.

**RIOT** We will describe the structure and key design and usage
elements of RIOT, an open-source operating system for
resource-constrained IoT devices. RIOT targets resource constrained
devices with very limited memory, CPU speed and
energy supply (kB, MHz, mW) and provides users with a feature
rich and extensible networking system.

**NDN-RIOT** We plan to introduce NDN-RIOT, an open-source
implementation of NDN protocol stack for RIOT, its structure,
APIs, and a few basic example how to create a simple NDNpowered
application for RIOT.
NDN-Android We will showcase how to enable NDN stack
on Android devices (i.e., by installing NDN-Android from Google
Play store) and show how to make a simple Android NDN apps
using jNDN.

**CCN-Lite** We plan to also introduce, give overview, and
showcase available tools for CCN-Lite, a lightweight implementation
of NDN/CCN supporting major packet formats such
as NDN and CCNx 1.0. CCN-Lite can run on different platforms
including Linux/Mac OS, RIOT, Arduino, Android, etc.
CCN-Lite consists of a core library, a packet encoding library
and a forwarder.

**FIT IoT-Lab Testbed** We will introduce tutorial participants
to the IoT-Lab Testbed, which consists of various constrained
devices (ARM Cortex M3, 32-bits, 72 Mhz, 64kB RAM). This
testbed is free and open for researchers worldwide, allowing
experimentation with IEEE 802.15.4 network in large-scale
scenarios.

**Named Function Networking** We also plan to give a brief
introduction of Named Function Networking (NFN), an innetwork
computation platform for ICN. NFN enables to define
user defined functions and workflows. NFN executes computations
transparent to the user and optimizes on which device
the computation is executed.

#### Hands-on
For the hands-on session, we plan to split into three tracks,
each working at their own speed and supported by tutors:

1. Demo-style track: a presentation will show how to setup
RIOT nodes and full integration into an ICN network

2. Hacking track 1: real-time developing of an application
to publish and read sensor data from constrained devices
using NDN-RIOT / CCN-lite on RIOT; showcasing use
of FIT IoT-lab testbed.

3. Hacking track 2: developing a processing pipeline for
sensor data on NDN or CCN-lite with NFN on Unix systems.
Merging the efforts At the end of the hands-on session, we
plan to merge the group projects. The sensor data from the
RIOT side should be collected by the relay on the Unix side
and processed by the developed pipelines. Furthermore, we
use NDN-JS or NDN Browser Plugins to visualizes the resulting
data.

### Requirements for the attendees

Participants should bring their own laptop and smartphone or tablet.
